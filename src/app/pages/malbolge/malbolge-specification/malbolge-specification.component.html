						Introduction

				<mat-divider></mat-divider>

				<p>It was noticed that, in the field of esoteric programming languages,
				there was a particular and surprising void: no programming language
				known to the author was specifically designed to be difficult to program
				in.</p>

				<p>Certainly, there were languages which were difficult to write in, and
				far more were difficult to read (see: Befunge, False, TWDL, RUBE...).
				But even INTERCAL and BrainF***, the two kings of mental torment, were
				designed with other goals: INTERCAL to have nothing in common with any
				major programming language, and BrainF*** to be a very tiny, yet still
				Turing-complete, language.</p>

				<p>INTERCAL's constructs are certainly tortuous, but they are all too
				flexible; you can, for instance, quite easily assign any number to a
				variable with a single statement.</p>

				<p>BrainF*** is lacking the flexibility which is INTERCAL's major weakness,
				but it fails in that its constructs are far, far too intuitive.
				Certainly, there are only 8 instructions, none of which take any
				arguments--but it is quite easy to determine how to use those
				instructions.  Subtract 8 from the current number?  With a simple
				'--------' you are done!  This kind of simple answer was unacceptable to
				the author.</p>

				<p>Hence the author created Malbolge.  It borrows from machine, BrainF***,
				and tri-INTERCAL, but put together in a unique way.  It was designed to
				be difficult to use, and so it is.  It is designed to be
				incomprehensible, and so it is.</p>

				<p>So far, no Malbolge programs have been written.  Thus, we cannot give an
				example.</p>

				<p>"Malbolge" is the name of Dante's Eighth Circle of Hell, in which
				practitioners of deception (seducers, flatterers, simonists, thieves,
				hypocrites, and so on) spend eternity.</p>

						Environment

				</mat-expansion-panel-header>
				<mat-divider></mat-divider>

				<p>The environment is, roughly, that of a primitive trinary CPU.  Both code
				and data share the same space (the machine's memory segment), and there
				are three registers.  Machine words are ten trits (trinary digits) wide,
				giving a maximum possible value of 59048 (all numbers are unsigned).
				Memory space is exactly 59049 words long.</p>

				<p>The three registers are A, C, and D.  A is the accumulator, used for
				data manipulation.  A is implicitly set to the value written by all
				write operations on memory.  (Standard I/O, a distinctly non-chip-level
				feature, is done directly with the A register.)</p>

				<p>C is the code pointer.  It is automatically incremented after each
				instruction, and points the instruction being executed.</p>

				<p>D is the data pointer.  It, too, is automatically incremented after each
				instruction, but the location it points to is used for the data
				manipulation commands.</p>

				<p>All registers begin with the value 0.</p>

				<p>When the interpreter loads the program, it ignores all whitespace.  If
				it encounters anything that is not one of an instruction and is not
				whitespace, it will give an error, otherwise it loads the file, one non-
				whitespace character per cell, into memory.  Cells which are not
				initialized are set by performing op on the previous two cells
				repetitively.</p>
